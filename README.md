# TicTacToe
Simply TicTacToe PvP (Player vs Player).
Simple tic-tac-toe game for two players. 
The player must enter the appropriate coordinates (from 0, 0 to 3, 3) to place an X or O on the board. 
The game always starts with X. After player X has made his move, the program automatically switches to O so that the other player can make his move. 
The game ends when one of the players manages to line up 3 characters on one line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal). 
If neither player succeeds in winning the game ends up as a draw. 
The program has a simple exception handling which makes it impossible to set your character on a occupied field, 
enter wrong coordinates or enter an incorrect character format.
